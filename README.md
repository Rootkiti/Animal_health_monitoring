# Animal_health_monitoring
This machine learning model utilizes symptom inputs to accurately diagnose diseases in Animal. This cutting-edge technology will contributing to the advancement of Animal health monitoring.

## Overview

In this repo, i will be using data obtained from kaggel.
the dataset contains information about 4 unique animals but, i will be more focused on `Cow`.
I will be exploring many classification algorithms using this dataset and each algorithm will have its unique file and later in this journey I will commbine all algorithms in one file and select the one that will score the highest.

### Algorithms that i will use

1. Decision Tree
2. Logistic Regression
3. Random Forest
4. K-Nearest Neighbors
5. Naive Bayes
6. Gradient Boosting Machines
